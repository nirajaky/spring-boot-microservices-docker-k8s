## Kubernetes Services
* Kubernetes Services are used to manage the PODS which are created/killed.
* Let's say we have three app: App-1, App-2 and App-3. Each having 3 PODS.
* And each app is having its services as svc-app-1, svc-app-2, svc-app-3
* So, for any PODs of App, which is created/killed is managed by its respective kubernetes services (svc.yaml)
* PODs are connected to respective services by POD definition (deploy.yaml) = 
     - spec -> selector -> matchLabels -> app: <service-name> 
* And in services PODs name is defined in (svc.yaml) = spec -> selector -> app: <service-name>

* Along with that targetPort in service should match with the containers-port in deployment of PODS
