## App Preperation
* For deployment of the applications, we need to publish all the images of applications to docker hub.
* Before publishing we need to update all the environment variables dynamically.
* Then run =  mvn clean install, to create the SNAPSHOT.jar file.
* Then create the docker image with tag eg.: docker build -t nirajaky/serviceregistry:0.0.1 .
* Now publish the docker image to docker hub via command: docker push nirajaky/serviceregistry:0.0.1
