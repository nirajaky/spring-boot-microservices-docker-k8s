## Ingress Service
* When a request comes from outside world to access our application, It can access through the IP address of our Service PODs with port.
* But, Ideally we use DNS to access the services. So, this DNS mapping use to happen by Ingress Controller.
* So, a request to DNS comes to Ingress controller, and then it is routed to a particular application Ingress service.
* So, we need to add Ingress controller to our K8s cluster, and it will automatically handle all the request to its respective services.
* We have some Ingress Controller which we can use like : AKS Application Gateway Ingress Controller, Ambassador, Apache Ingress, Gloo etc.
* All the Cloud provider have Load Balancer which have Ingress controller within it, and we can create Ingress service within it. 
* So, we don't need to externally add Ingress in our Cloud service. 

## Locally
* In local, we can enable Ingress.
