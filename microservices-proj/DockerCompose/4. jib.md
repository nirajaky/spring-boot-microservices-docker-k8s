## JIB
- Jib builds optimized Docker and OCI images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon and without deep mastery of Docker best-practices.
- It is available as plugins for Maven and Gradle and as a Java library. It helps us to build the application (OCI) image without the Dockerfile or Docker.
