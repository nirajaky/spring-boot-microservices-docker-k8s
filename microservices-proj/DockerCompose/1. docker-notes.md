# Docker
⁃ Docker is a containerization platform that you can use to package software in containers and run 
  them on target machines.Docker containers run on any mach
⁃ We can have multiple docker container running in same port(internal port), but from the host 
  machine we should access those with different port.
- Actually, there is mapping between host port and docker container ports.

## Commands
* docker pull <image-name>
- example: docker pull redis, docker pull redis:latest

* docker images
- Lists down all the images present in the system

* docker inspect <container-id> or docker inspect <image-id> 
- Gives the information of image and container in JSON format

- it = intractive mode, if we wants to go inside the container shell and run some commands 
- different conatiner have different kinds of Shell, like sh, bash, ish etc..
